## Raspberry Pi - Realtime Clock (RTC) Python Demo

 # This example code is for testing the ATMegaZero RTC Shield on the Raspbery Pi.

 # You can purchase one of the ATMegaZero RTC Shield from the ATMegaZero Online Store at:

import sys
import time
import datetime

import SDL_DS3231

print  "Testing the ATMegaZero RTC Shield"

ds3231 = SDL_DS3231.SDL_DS3231(1, 0x68)
ds3231.write_now()

# To make the DS3231 hardware clock different from the Piâ€™s clock, we can use the write_all() command. e.g.
# ds3231.write_all(seconds,minutes,hours,day,date,month,year,save_as_24h=True)

# Main Loop, reads and prints values of the clock

while True:
    print "Raspberry Pi =\t" + time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    print "DS3231 =\t\t%s" % ds3231.read_datetime()
    print "DS3231 Temp =", ds3231.getTemp()
    time.sleep(10.0)

```
## Result

```python
$ python rtc_demo.py
